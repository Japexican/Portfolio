                    <p>
                        Hello, my name is Sebastian Doreste. I am from Auburn, Alabama. 
                        I have always loved anything to do with technology, but never 
                        knew how to truely make it into a career. Recently I decided to 
                        stop wasting my life away in places I was not happy and start a 
                        new career doing something I love. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To make my dream come true I decided to attend the University of 
                        Central Florida to pursue their full stack web development course. 
                        By the end of the course I will be adept in HTML, CSS, Git, Github, 
                        JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, AJAX, Node, Express, MySQL, Handlebars, 
                        Sequelize, Heroku, MongoDB, and React.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I enjoy taking on challenging tasks and solving them quickly and efficiently.
                        I am very motivated and willing to learn. I am excited to start 
                        a new career, collaborate with my peers to achieve our goals, and learn 
                        new skills that will enable me to grow and become a gret asset to any team I work with.
                    </p>
